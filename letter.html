                Happiest birthday 🎉 my lovely husband 🫂 and my dearest person in my life 💝.  
                I have some words to share with you as it is a special occasion 😍. First, I should say thank you so much for coming into my life 🫂🫂... I feel lucky to have you 🤌🏻🥹. Having you in my life is the best thing that has happened to me, maybe not for you, but for me, you're my lucky charm 💫⚡. You're the best in everything according to me. You're my best supporter, guide, and well-wisher, you're my 🌎... You always wish me and guide me 🧑🏻‍🏫 to have a better future, but I also irritate you 😢 with my behavior. I know it's wrong 😞, but I am unable to come to the correct path. I am so sorry for everything because you got hurt by me many times, and I am sorry for not keeping my promises about studies 😞 and for doing things that make you angry.  
                You're the most important person in my life, I may not express my feelings through my actions, but I literally have them, and you deserve the best 🤍... You deserve a sorry and thanks from my side 😊.  
                All this aside, I want to promise 🫳 you on your 25th birthday as a silver jubilee to YOU 😝. I want to share everything with you, whether it’s your pain or work, anything it might be, I will always be with you, believe me, please 🤌🏻.  
                Don’t worry about me, I know my laziness hurts the most and you're being affected by it indirectly, believe me, someday I will change. Take care of your health; it's enough for me.  
                And I want to say thank you for breaking the line between my imagination and fear 🤗. I want to be with you more, as a best friend 👩‍❤️‍👨. I want you to be my diary 📙.  
                I have many wishes to fulfill, but I personally don’t want them. I just want to enjoy myself 🧚🏻 without any fear; you should be my big supporter.... 😒 and you should join me and make beautiful memories throughout our journey 🤗🤗....  
                In relationships, all the fights are common. I personally feel we should not get affected by those for the next day. Mainly, you get angrier and say something. One day I decided not to share anything with you because you always say that you don't have any peace. Apudu naku challa badha anipisthunadhi akkuva time aduguthuna ani edo edo annavu oka book lo rasanu aroju netho emi cheppaleka inka mataladleka chala anatey chala badha anipichindhi 😞.

                Inkoti apudina nenu godava padhitey nenu mataladlenu ra godavalo please understand acting adhi edhi words une cheystey bogodhu mudey cheputhunaa 😬.
